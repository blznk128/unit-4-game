# unit-4-game

I had a tough time seperating the random numbers the Math.random method returned. I originally just re wrote the
lines of code for each crystal but realized there has to be a easier, shorter way to get the same result.
Before I sat up a function, but realized all 4 crystal shared the same random number that was generated.
Then the issue I had was each time I clicked the crystal, it kept picking a different number everytime, I fixed that, then
it wouldnt add properly after it chose a new number. Eventually I got those issues fixed, then I realized when the random number
players have to get reset to another number, it wouldn't update it on the screen. This homework definitely challenged everything
I know about javascript and had to read the activities over and over and also read a book about javascript to figure it out.
